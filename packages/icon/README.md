# @react-md/icon

Create icons using a font-icon library like material-icons or font-awesome or
plain old accessible SVG icons. There are also a few additional helpers to
creating animating rotating icons and separating text from an icon.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save @react-md/icon
```

It is also recommended to install the other packages if you have not done so:

```sh
$ npm install --save @react-md/theme @react-md/typography
```

## Pre-made material icons

If you would like to have access to all material icons as existing components
instead of having to manually remember the correct `children` to provide or the
correct `path`, you can install the `@react-md/material-icons` package. This
will include **all** material icons as font and SVGs.
