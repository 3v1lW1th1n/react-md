The `Sheet` component supports being fixed to the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and
`left` sides of the page by default. Since `react-md` also supports
right-to-left languages the sheet will automatically update the `left` and
`right` positioning when the `dir="rtl"` is applied to any parent element. You
can test this out by toggling this app's language direction in the main app bar.
