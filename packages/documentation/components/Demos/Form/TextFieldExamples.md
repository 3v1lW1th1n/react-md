Text fields come with three different styles out of the box:

- underline
- filled
- outline

as well as an unstyled version.

The `underlined` version will have a floating label as well as a underline that
both gain different colors based on user interaction. When the user focuses the
input, the label will float above the text field and the placeholder text will
be shown.

The `filled` version is an extension of the underline where it just adds a
background color as well to the text field.

Finally, the `outline` version is the same as the underlined version except that
there is now a border around the entire text field.
