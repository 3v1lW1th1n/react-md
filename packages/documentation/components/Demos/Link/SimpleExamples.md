The link component is fairly new for `react-md` and I'm still trying to figure
out reasonable defaults for it. The link will use the primary color by default
for unvisited links and different shades of the primary color for visited or
hover. This is ok for light themed apps, but within dark themed apps, it looks
horrid if you have a dark primary color.
