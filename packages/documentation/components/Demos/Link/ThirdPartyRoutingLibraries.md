You can also render the `Link` component using a third-party link/routing
library. Popular examples are:

- [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [@reach/router](https://github.com/reach/router)
- [next.js][1]

Since this documentation site is using [next.js][1], I'll show an example below
using that, but you can use the same pattern for the other libraries as well.
