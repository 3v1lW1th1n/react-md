A dialog is used to show important content above all other elements within the
page. This is normally used for alerts, confirmations, or just temporary
content. The dialog within react-md also has the additional features:

- automatically focus the dialog on mount for keyboard users
- prevent elements outside of the dialog to be focused
- close via the escape key (see the [modal example below](#modal-dialog-example)
  for more info)
- prevent the page outside of the dialog from being scrolled
