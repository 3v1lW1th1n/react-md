The most common usage of the `@react-md/list` package will be to create single
line lists that are interactable. This can be accomplished using the `List` and
`ListItem` components exported by this package. The `ListItem` component will
create a keyboard focusable and clickable element that gains the different
interaction states.

The `ListItem` can also be modified to have icons, avatars, or media placed with
the main content.
