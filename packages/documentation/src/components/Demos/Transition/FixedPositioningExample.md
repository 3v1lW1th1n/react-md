This package also exports a pretty awesome hook: `useFixedPositioning` that ties
in directly with the `react-transition-group` API so that you can position a
fixed element to another element within the page ensuring that it can fit within
the viewport. Some great existing examples of this component are the #menu and
#tooltip packages since they use this hook behind the scenes position themselves
automatically.

> This is a newer version of the `Layout` component if you used `react-md@v1`
