/// This is the main interaction states creator. It will apply all the styles
/// to an element so that it will:
/// - gain the pointer cursor when it is not disabled (also works for aria-disabled)
/// - create a `::before` element for transitioning between the different interaction
///   states
/// - apply the hover opacity when not disabled **and for non-touch devices** (see more below)
/// - apply the focused opacity after a **keyboard** focus event (see more below)
/// - apply the pressed opacity if not using the ripple effect (see more below)
///
/// ### Hover Opacity
/// This requires the usage of a `COMPONENT_TO_MAKE` to work correctly. If `COMPONENT_TO_MAKE` is
/// not used in your application, the hover effect will be applied on mobile devices after touch
/// events. This is because a touch event still goes through the mouse events and applies the
/// hover state after being touched.
///
/// ### Focused Opacity
/// This requires the usage of the `KeyboardTracker` component to work correctly. If the
/// `KeyboardTracker` is not used in your application and not near the root of the React render
/// tree, you most likely will not have any focus states. This is actually one of the "biggest"
/// features of react-md until the `:focus-visible` css selector has gained traction and browser
/// support.
///
/// ### Pressed Opacity
/// If you are using the ripple effect for pressed states, this will be ignored as a ripple element
/// will be created instead to show the pressed state. When the ripple effect is disabled, pressing
/// an element will just trigger a background opacity change like the over interaction states.
