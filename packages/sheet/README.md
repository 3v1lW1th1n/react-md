# @react-md/sheet

A sheet is an extension of the `Dialog` component that allows for creating a
fixed element that appears inline with other content fixed to the viewport
borders. Sheets are great for:

- containing a persistent navigation tree on desktop
- containing a temporary navigation tree on any device size
- creating dropdown menus on mobile

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save @react-md/sheet
```

It is also recommended to install these other packages as they work hand-in-hand
with this package:

```sh
$ npm install --save @react-md/theme \
    @react-md/typography \
    @react-md/list \
    @react-md/dialog \
    @react-md/icon \
    @react-md/material-icons
```
