# Hooks

- Hooks let you use state and other React features without using a class
- Motivation behind the hooks
  - Itâ€™s hard to reuse stateful logic between components
  - Complex components become hard to understand
  - Developers don't like classes
- Hooks are available now in React starting from version 16.8
