# dev-utils

This is a private package within react-md to do common development scripts. The
main use case for this package is so that I don't need to remember to keep
re-installing dev dependencies in each project and all the tsconfig files. All
of it will be handled automatically behind the scenes.

For more info, run `yarn dev-utils --help`.
