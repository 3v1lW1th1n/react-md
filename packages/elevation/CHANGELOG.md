# v2.0.0-alpha.0

This is a re-write of the old `Paper` component as well as the paper styles. It
has now been renamed to `elevation` to match the material design specs.

## Breaking Changes

- There is no longer a component that you can use to create an elevated element.
  You will need to manually use the `rmd-elevation` mixin instead
- The main mixin was renamed: `md-box-shadow` -> `rmd-elevation`

## New Features

- There are now 24 different types of shadows available instead of 5.
