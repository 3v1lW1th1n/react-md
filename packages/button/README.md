# @react-md/button

Create native buttons with multiple themes based on the material design
specifications including:

- clear, primary, secondary, warning, error, and default theme states
- text, icon, or text + icon with spacing
- flat, outlined, or contained

Also includes an `FakeButton` component that can be used to create a `<div>`
that behaves like a native button element with the required accessibility.

Also includes a `theme` function that can be used to apply a button theme to
_any_ component by generating the required `className` prop.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save @react-md/button
