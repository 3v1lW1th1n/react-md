# @react-md/wia-aria

This package's main goal is to create a reusable API for keyboard navigation and
focucs. In addition, it will create the base functionality following the
[Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex)
patterns for accessible web applications. It should hopefully not always require
`react-md` for these widgets as they will all be unstyled and only manage the
focus abilities as a low-level API.

This will be accomplished by following the guidelines outlined in the
[Developing a Keyboard Interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#keyboard)
from [https://w3.org](https://w3.org).
